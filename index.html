    <h2 class="Mythology" id="mythology">Greek Mythology:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Greek mythology is a truly spectacular thing, including gods, goddesses, heroes and many wondrous myths that shape their culture. The Titans and Olympians are key figures in Greek mythology with legends of battles and wars.</p></li>
    <li><p class="Quote">”The basics of Greek mythology are the gods and goddesses and their mythical history. The stories found in Greek mythology are colorful, allegorical, and include moral lessons for those who want them and puzzles to mull over for those who don't. They include profound human truths and the basics of western culture.”-ThoughtCo.</p></li>
    <li><p>Greek mythology tells stories about gods and goddesses or other magical beings and even sometimes about ordinary people. Some of these gods and goddesses are called olympians because they ruled the earth from their throne in mount Olympus.</p></li>
    <li><p>In Greek mythology the beginning was chaos and nothing else, for them chaos isn't a god, it's an elemental source. A force made purely of itself its been since the start and ill go till the end.And out of that chaos other things formed like earth, sky and love.</p></li>
    <li><p>The first generation of named forces in Greek mythology after the passage of time became more like humans, The Titans were the children of Gaia(earth) and Ouranos(Sky) and later the olympian gods and goddesses were born later as the grandchildren of Earth and Sky.</p></li>
    <li><p class="Quote">“The Titans and the Olympians inevitably came into conflict, called the Titanomachy. The ten year battle of the immortals was won by the Olympians, but the Titans did leave a mark on ancient history: the giant holding the world on his shoulders, Atlas, is a Titan.” – ThoughtCo.</p></li>
    <li><p>Earth(Gaia) and Sky(Ouranos/Uranus) who are elemental forces produced many offspring like 100 armed monsters and one eyed ciclones. In the end earth forged a sickle with which her son Cronus unmanned his father</p></li>
    <li><p>In the end Greek mythology is an amazing subject and a really complex one as there are many magical beings and many stories of death and love, this was rooted deep in the culture of greeks in order to explain the world around them, just how we in the modern world used telescopes to investigate the sun, they used their minds to speculate the truth of our universe. </p></li>

    <h2 class="WOF" id="wof">Way of life:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>The ancient greek kept themselves busy and they were constantly doing chores, shopping in markets, performing jury service, etc. It was a civilization full of work and people working but also doing other stuff like playing music or pondering about life and death.        </p></li>
        <li><p>Clothing in ancient Greece included a wide variety of clothes around the body: an undergarment and a cloak were usually worn by ancient greeks</p></li>
        <li><p>Clothes were quite simple, draped, loose-fitting and free-flowing. Customarily, clothing was homemade and cut to various lengths of rectangular linen or wool fabric with minimal cutting or sewing, and secured with ornamental clasps or pins, and a belt, or girdle. Pieces were generally interchangeable between men and women. However, women usually wore their robes to their ankles while men generally wore theirs to their knees depending on the occasion and circumstance. Additionally, clothing often served many purposes than just being used as clothes such as bedding or a shroud. </p></li>
        <li><p class="Quote">“After eating and drinking and the pouring of libations, the guests at a symposium might play games, listen to and perform music (especially the lyre), tell each other stories, give each other advice on daily problems, discuss politics and enjoy each other's company. Poetry recitals were a common element. Guests were also encouraged to show off their own poetic and intellectual skills with off the cuff recitals and repartee. Drinking continued throughout the evening, usually through the passing around of a shared cup or kylix. Singing of songs was also popular and on occasion, the group of revellers (komos) even went out into the streets to continue their singing and dancing, no doubt to the annoyance of the neighbours”.-- World History Encyclopedia </p></li>
        <li><p>This shows that greek people were ordered and cared about their way of living, being efficient with work and their daily lives, this could possibly be one of the reasons why there were so many wonderful and great philosophers, craftsman and more, not because they were genetically smarter or because they were richer than all others but because their culture allowed them to become very efficient and become highly productive mastering many different topics from across the world.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Greeks invented many, many important things for the world starting from the wheel to key mathematical equations, some think that it was because their way of living was centered across being busy and always doing stuff leading to many great inventions that humanity could not have proceeded without, for example the wheel is a key object for humanity to thrive as if we still did not have the wheel our civilization would be magnitude of orders more primitive.</p></li>

    </ul>
    <h2 class="Tradition" id="tradition">Traditions and culture:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Greek customs and traditions are very cool and show a lot about their style of living and how they thought about the universe, we see them as ordered efficient people that give value to work and to efficiency which led them to a lot of early technological advancements and a lot of overall efficiency in their culture and traditions for example the wheel allowed people to farm and cultivate more efficiently by allowing them to carry resources in bigger quantities and faster leading to more food and less worry over huger allowing them to shift focus to other things like making farmer even more efficient.</p></li>
        <li><p class="Quote">“There are customs and traditions everywhere you look in Greece. Some, like Easter and Christmas, are religious holidays while others, like Carnival and May Day, have their roots in ancient Greek festivals and rituals. They feature traditional songs and dances, as well as colourful costumes and local dishes, and they bring communities to church and families around the dining table. Others, like summer festivals, are full of Greeks’ famous love of life, welcoming locals and guests to eat, drink and dance in village squares. What all Greek customs and traditions have in common is that locals love to celebrate them and invite everyone else to join in.” –  Discover greece</p></li>
        <li><p>Greek customs and traditions blend ancient rituals with religious celebrations, featuring vibrant costumes, dances, and local foods that bring communities together. Key events include Carnival with its lively parades, Clean Monday marking the start of Lent with kite flying and special meals, and Easter, the most important festival celebrated with unique local customs. August 15 honours the Assumption of the Virgin Mary with pilgrimages and festivals, while Christmas and New Year involve carols, special foods, and rituals like breaking a pomegranate for luck. These traditions highlight Greece’s rich cultural heritage and communal spirit.</p></li>
        <li><p>Memorable dances include the Tsamikos, where participants hold each other’s hands with their elbows bent at right angles and the last person of the line or circle performs acrobatic leaps. Likewise, there are many versions of the Syrtos, where dancers form a chain or circle and the leader breaks away to perform improvised steps. Variations include the Chaniotikos, Kalamatianos, Ikariotikos, and Roditikos pidiktos (named after the destination) as well as the Balos (performed in pairs). Cretan dances include the Pentozalis, the Maleviziotikos and the Sousta, just as there are Pontic folk dances, the Zonaradikos dance of Thrace, and the Rouga or Perdika dances of Corfu.</p></li>
        <li><p>Everywhere in Greece does Carnival in its own way. The biggest carnival is held in Patras (culminating in a grand Sunday parade) and there are colourful carnivals everywhere from Xanthi in the north to Naoussa in the Peloponnese, which involves a performance of Genitsari (unmarried young men) and brides known as Boules (also performed by men). In Galaxidi, the Alevromomoutzouromata involves colourful flour being thrown in the streets, and Amfissa recreates the Night of the Ghosts (recalling the story of a young tanner who took his life when his fiancée was killed by lightning). Kalamata is famous for its gaitanaki dances and in Ioannina locals dance around fires called tzamales.</p></li>
        <li><p>Carnival is also a special time on Greek islands, including Corfu (where costumes have a Venetian flair), Syros and Naxos. The Rethymno Carnival in Crete is always lively and the Skyros Carnival features the pagan ritual of young men representing the geros (old man) wearing goat masks, animal hides and goat bells and women (the korela or daughter) wearing bridal veils.</p></li>
        <li><p>This shows just how cool and diverse greek traditions and culture is and how they think and live.</p></li>

    <h2 class="Conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Ancient Greece was one of the most influential civilizations in human history. Its mythology, full of gods, heroes, and mythical beings, provided not only entertainment but also explanations for the mysteries of the world and moral lessons for daily life. At the same time, the Greeks’ way of living—busy, efficient, and intellectually curious—fostered an environment where philosophy, science, politics, and art could flourish. Their inventions, ideas, and cultural practices shaped the foundations of Western civilization, much like their myths shaped their own understanding of the universe. Without the achievements of Ancient Greece, from mythology to daily life innovations, the world as we know it today would not be the same.</p>
